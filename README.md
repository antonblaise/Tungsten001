# Tungsten001
This is my personal Discord bot, named after my favourite DPS in Genshin Impact, Eula Lawrence,
codenamed the toughest metal on earth, tungsten.

# Functions
## Check public IP information of my home network.
- The IP address is essential to generate an OpenVPN certificate and use it to connect to my home network from anywhere over the internet.

## Generate and send OpenVPN certificate
- By fetching the latest public IP address of my home network, an OpenVPN certificate is generated and sent through a text channel.

## 6-hour weather forecast
- Weather forecast for a city or town can be given both on request and automatically following a schedule, i.e. once per 4 hours.

## More is on the way!
- There's no specific task that I need Eula to handle for me. The repository and the coding might be a kinda sloppy and disorganised, but whenever I get an idea in my head, I'm just gonna add it in. After all, this is my very first time using Git/Github, and this is just my personal helper bot. Nonetheless, do feel free to clone it and play around as you like!
